This is the vector class library (version 1.02 beta) by Agner Fog, repackaged for the use in LightMatrix.

The original library is available at:

	www.agner.org/optimize
	
We repackaged this library as follows:

	1) divide long headers into smaller ones
 	2) encapsulate all names in a namespace lmat::vc
 	3) provide forward declarations of all classes in a specific header file
 	4) use primitive types in prim_types.h
