Welcome to LightMatrix
=========================

**LightMatrix** is a C++ template library for matrix computation, which provides a unique combination of *design-time productivity* and *run-time performance*.
With this library, user can write codes using a set of friendly APIs (just like in MATLAB). These codes will then be transparently translated to highly optimized routines (at compile-time), through a meta-programming engine.
